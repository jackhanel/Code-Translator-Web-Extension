This web extension respects your privacy. This policy outlines how we handle information when you use our Chrome extension.

1. Information We Collect

    We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal or sensitive user data.

    When you use the extension to translate code snippets, the selected code is sent anonymously to our backend server solely for translation purposes.

    For performance optimization, the extension temporarily caches translated code snippets within your current browser session. This cache is stored in-memory and is cleared when the browser or tab is closed. No data is stored persistently or transmitted to third parties.

2. Use of Data

    The extension only processes the code you highlight and send for translation. This data is:

        Not stored on our servers.
        Not linked to any personal identity.
        Used only in real-time to provide translated code.

3. Third-Party Services

    We use OpenAI's API for translation processing. No personal data is sent to OpenAI—only the code snippet and requested target language are submitted during translation.

4. Security

    While we don’t store any user data, we ensure secure communication between the extension and our backend via HTTPS.

5. User Control

    You can uninstall the extension at any time via Chrome's extensions manager. No data will remain after uninstallation.

6. Changes to This Policy

    If this policy changes, we’ll update the text on our extension listing page and the extension’s support site
